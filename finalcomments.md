# Interactivity
The interaction here was extensive, and I'm really impressed by how much you were able to get done in a really short time. I know it doesn't work exactly as you wished, but it's, overall, a fun little game.

# Code Quality
You did well at commenting and describing your code, and the code itself is fairly clean. You might have been able to clean up some of those if/thens by using functions and objects, but this is a minor quibble.

# Aesthetics
As I said above, this doesn't do everything you wanted it to do, but you managed to produce a nice experience for your user. Great work.
